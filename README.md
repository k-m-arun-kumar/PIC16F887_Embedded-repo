Description :
=============
I just shared my works, which I worked as learning path and practiced Embedded C programming using PIC16F887 (Microchip's 8 bit microcontroller in PIC16 family) for interface of LED, Switch, 7 Segment LED, Keypad and LCD, Timer, ADC, Interrupt, UART, EEPROM, RTC, SPI, I2C, GSM and CCP. Other features are not implemented. 

Projects, using PIC16F887, are included with Design, development, implemented, simulated and tested, by using a simulator are as follows :
===========================================================================================================================================
 1: smart milk vending machine. 
 2: Simple Digital Single phase Electric Motor Controller controlled by Electric current.
 3: Simple Digital Single phase Electric Motor Controller controlled by Electric Voltage.
 4: Soil moisture based Water spraying system for nursery farms.
 5: Traffic density congestion control based traffic signal controller.
 6: Construction automation for mixing of cement, sand and water in the construction mixture equipment. 
 7: In LCD, running text is displayed either to left or to right with specified number of gaps between consecutive same text display.

Purpose :
=========
In all my respective repositories, I just shared my works that I worked as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files and some programming that might not being implement, not being completed, lacks some features or have some bugs. Purpose of all my repositories, if used, can be used for learning and educational purpose only. It can be used as the open source and freeware. Kindly read the LICENSE.txt for license, terms and conditions about the use of source codes, binaries, documentation and all other files, located in all my repositories. 

Autography :
============
I, K.M. Arun Kumar alias Arunkumar Murugeswaran, in the year 2003, graduated (B.E. in Electronics and Instrumentation Engineering (EIE) at Government College of Technology (GCT), Coimbatore, India), was a C developer, with 2 years of work experience (2003-2005) at a company, based in Chennai, India, as a network programmer (using C programming language), in a role of Software engineer in Design & Development Team, in domain of Remote Access Server (RAS). I resigned from that company, due to work stress that I was unable to bear, which affected my health and then treatment given by a doctor, which was not suitable for my health, worsen my health. After a rehabitation process in my health, thanks to my mother, sister and family, healthcare, myself, god and all those who directly or indirectly helped me and my family, which helped me to recover my health. I again practiced and refresh C programming.
 
I have a career break from 2005 - present, in 2018-2019, I also learned some Embedded C Programmming using ATMEL AT89C51, PIC16F887, PIC18F4680 and LPC2138 to practise Embedded C programmming and searched for the job. But in vain, mainly due to my career break and my age. 

Till present, I just shared my works that I used as the learning path and practiced, with designed, developed, implemented, simulated and tested, including some projects, assignments, documentations and all other related files.
